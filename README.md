# Incident-Breach-Response
Incident &amp; Breach Response
# Breach Response Playbook – HealthTrack App

##  Purpose
This playbook outlines how HealthTrack will respond to a **personal data breach** in compliance with **PIPEDA** and global best practices.  

A data breach may involve unauthorized access, disclosure, loss, or misuse of personal information (e.g., email addresses, health logs, location data).

---

##  Guiding Principles
- **Timeliness:** Respond quickly — PIPEDA requires notification "as soon as feasible."  
- **Transparency:** Communicate openly with affected individuals and regulators.  
- **Accountability:** Assign clear roles and responsibilities.  
- **Mitigation:** Contain, assess, and prevent recurrence.  

---

##  Step-by-Step Response Process

### 1. Detection & Reporting
- All staff trained to **report suspicious activity immediately**.  
- Centralized reporting channel: `privacy@healthtrack.ca`.  
- Log the incident in the **Breach Register**.  

---

### 2. Initial Containment
- IT team isolates affected systems.  
- Disable compromised accounts/access.  
- Stop further unauthorized use or disclosure.  

---

### 3. Assessment & Risk Evaluation
- **What happened?** (e.g., phishing attack, lost device, ransomware).  
- **What data is involved?** (sensitive health logs vs. email only).  
- **Who is affected?** (one user, a group, or entire customer base).  
- **Likelihood of harm?** (identity theft, embarrassment, financial loss).  

 Tool: Use **Risk Matrix** (included in repo) to classify breach as **Low / Medium / High severity**.  

---

### 4. Notification Obligations
#### Under PIPEDA:
- Report breach to the **Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC)** if it poses a “real risk of significant harm.”  
- Notify **affected individuals** directly (email, in-app notification).  
- Notify **third parties** who can help mitigate harm (e.g., banks, law enforcement).  
- Maintain **records of all breaches** for at least 24 months, even if not reported.  

 Global Note:  
- GDPR: notify supervisory authority within **72 hours**.  
- U.S. State Laws: notification timelines vary (often 30–60 days).

### 5. Communication Templates
- **User Notification Email Example:**  

  > Subject: Important Notice – Security Incident  
  >  
  > Dear [User],  
  >  
  > We are writing to inform you of a recent incident that may have involved your personal data (steps, calorie logs, email).  
  >  
  > What happened: [Plain-language description]  
  >  
  > What we are doing: [Containment & mitigation steps]  
  >  
  > What you can do: [Change password, enable 2FA, monitor accounts]  
  >  
  > We take your privacy seriously and will provide updates.  
  >  
  > – The HealthTrack Privacy Team  

---

### 6. Post-Incident Remediation
- Conduct **root cause analysis** (e.g., patch vulnerabilities, improve training).  
- Update security controls (multi-factor authentication, encryption upgrades).  
- Review and update **incident response plan**.  
- Conduct **tabletop exercise** within 3 months.  

---

##  Roles & Responsibilities
- **Privacy Officer:** Leads investigation, decides if reportable under PIPEDA (RROSH)
- **IT Security Team:** Containment, forensic analysis, system hardening.  
- **Communications Team:** Drafts and sends notifications.  
- **Legal/Compliance:** Reviews obligations across jurisdictions.  
- **Executive Sponsor:** Approves public disclosures.
